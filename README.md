# Bug Bounty Reports (Redacted Samples)

This repository contains redacted examples of vulnerability reports I have submitted
through responsible disclosure programs (Bugcrowd, HackerOne, etc.).

## 🎯 Goals
- Showcase clear and professional vulnerability reporting.
- Provide structured templates for future bug submissions.
- Demonstrate track record as part of an application.

## 📂 Structure
- `report-template.md` — General template I use for all submissions.
- `sample-report.md` — Redacted report showing my reporting style and PoC documentation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All reports here are **redacted** and stripped of sensitive information.
They are shared only for educational and demonstration purposes.
